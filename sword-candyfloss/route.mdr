Wooloo Herding Tips
- **Don't get too close to the Wooloo.** You can "push" them from a distance and getting closer doesn't make them go any faster. Getting *too* close to them can cause them to scatter wildly.
- **Use the walls.** Herding Wooloo along the walls will keep them mostly together. Once the Wooloo hit the slanted walls at the end of each section, they'll typically herd themselves in.
- **Don't panic.** If some Wooloo get away from you, focus on getting your main horde to the goal. Then go back and scoop up the stragglers.
:::

**Wooloo Puzzles**
- 1) Move in a zigzag pattern (left-up, right-up, left-up, right-up) to try and get all three Wooloo groups into a single cluster. Then push them straight to the goal zone.
- 2) The Yamper on this route moves side-to-side. Head directly toward the Wooloo herd and push it straight into the goal. You want to put the Wooloo in the goal BEFORE fighting the trainer.

![Final Herding Challenge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gavinNBD/ranger-routes/main/shield-candyfloss/assets/WoolooHerding.gif)
- 4b) Alternatively, you can wait until the right-side Yamper starts heading north, then SLOWLY push the Wooloo herd while you follow that Yamper. Try not get the herd too close to Yamper. 
- Once the final puzzle is done, head up the stairs and down the tunnel.
